                    Hello, as you may know already my name is Ruskin Acevedo. I am a
                    fullstack web developer student at Georgia Tech.
                    I went to school at York College for Accounting and Business administration.
                    As time passed I noticed that that was something I did not really wanted
                    to do.

                    I currently live in the beautiful city of New York and work for a
                    private company as a Logistics Manager/Business Contact where I manage a team
                    of over 30 drivers.
                    I always had a passion for tech and coding but never pulled the trigger on
                    actually learning the subject, but with the help of friends and family
                    I decided to start my journey on tech this 2023 year.

                        Marketing.
                        This
                        project included a codebase that follows accessibility standards so
                        that their site is optimized for search engines to make it
                        easier for future clients.
